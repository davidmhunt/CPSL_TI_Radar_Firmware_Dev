/** @mainpage Millimeter Wave (mmw) Demo for AM273X
 * [TOC]
 *  @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 *  @image html toplevel.png
 *
 *  The millimeter wave demo shows some of the capabilities of the AM273X SOC
 *  using the drivers in the mmWave SDK (Software Development Kit).
 *  It allows user to specify the chirping profile and displays the detected
 *  objects and other information in real-time.
 *
 *  Following is a high level description of the features of this demo:
 *  - Be able to specify desired chirping profile through command line interface (CLI)
 *    on a UART port or through the TI Gallery App - **mmWave Demo Visualizer** -
 *    that allows user to provide a variety of profile configurations via the UART input port
 *    and displays the streamed detected output from another UART port in real-time,
 *    as seen in picture above.
 *  - Some sample profile configurations have been provided in the demo directory that can be
 *    used with CLI directly or via **mmWave Demo Visualizer** under following directory:
 *    @verbatim mmw/profiles @endverbatim
 *  - Do 1D, 2D, CFAR, Azimuth and Elevation processing and stream out velocity
 *    and three spatial coordinates (x,y,z) of the detected objects in real-time.
 *    The demo can also be configured to do 2D only detection (velocity and x,y coordinates).
 *  - Various display options besides object detection like Doppler-range heat map.
 *
 *  @section procChain Processing Chains
 *    Two processing chains are available for the AWR294X demo.
      Check @verbatim
      ti/datapath/dpc/objectdetection/objdethwa/docs/doxygen/html/index.html
      @endverbatim
      or
      @verbatim
      ti/datapath/dpc/objectdetection/objdethwaDDMA/docs/doxygen/html/index.html
      @endverbatim
 *    for details on the processing chains. The CLI arguments for each chain are available in
 *    the User Guide.
 *  - TDM (Time Division Multiplexing): Here, no two transmitters are active at the same time.
 *    At the receiver antennae, there is no ambiguity on the chirp received, and every received
 *    chirp can directly be mapped, without the need of a separate disambiguation, to the corresponding
 *    Tx antenna.  The antenna support for this chain is (AzimTx, ElevTx, Rx) = (2,1,4), (2,1,4),
 *    (2,0,4), (1,0,1), (1,0,2), (1,0,4) for AWR294X and additionally (3,1,4) and (3,0,4) for AWR2944.
 *  - DDM (Doppler Division Multiplexing): Here, all transmitters are active at the same time.
 *    At the receiver antennae, the received chirps need to be disambiguated (demodulation)
 *    to obtain samples corresponding to each Tx antenna. The antenna support for this chain is
 *    (AzimTx, ElevTx, Rx) = (2,1,4) for AWR2943 and (3,1,4) for AWR2944.
 *
 *   Feature | AWR2943-DDM | AWR2943-TDM | AWR2944-DDM |  AWR2944-DDM
 *  :----|:-------------------------|:---------------------------|:-----------------------------------|:-----------------------------------:
 *   Legacy Frame | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes
 *   Advanced subframe | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes
 *   LVDS Streaming | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes
 *   Enet Streaming | No | Yes | No | Yes
 *   Range Bias Estimation/Compensation | No | Yes | No | Yes
 *   RX Gain/Phase Estimation/Compensation | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes
 *
 *  @section limit Limitations
 *  - Because of UART speed limit (< 1 Mbps), the frame time is more restrictive.
 *    For example, for the azimuth and Doppler heat maps for 256 FFT range and
 *    16 point FFT Doppler, it takes about 200 ms to transmit.
 *  - For most boards, a range bias of few centimeters has been observed. User can estimate
 *    the range bias on their board and correct using the calibration procedure
 *    described in @ref Calibration_section.
 *
 *  @section systemFlow System Execution Flow
 *  The millimeter wave demo runs on R4F (MSS) and DSP(DSS). Following diagram shows the system
 *  execution flow
 *
 *  @image html system_flow1.png "System Execution Flow"
 *
 *  @section tasks Software Tasks
 *    The demo consists of the following (FreeRTOS) tasks:
 *
 *    **MSS**
 *    - @ref MmwDemo_initTask. This task is created/launched by @ref main and is a
 *      one-time active task whose main functionality is to initialize drivers (\<driver\>_init),
 *      MMWave module (MMWave_init), DPM module (DPM_init), open UART and other drivers (SPI),
 *      and create/launch the following tasks
 *      (the @ref CLI_task is launched indirectly by calling @ref CLI_open).
 *    - @ref CLI_task. This command line interface task provides a simplified 'shell' interface
 *      which allows the configuration of the BSS via the mmWave interface (MMWave_config).
 *      It parses input CLI configuration commands like chirp profile and GUI configuration.
 *      When sensor start CLI command is parsed, all actions related to starting sensor and
 *      starting the processing the data path are taken.
 *      When sensor stop CLI command is parsed, all actions related to stopping the sensor and
 *      stopping the processing of the data path are taken
 *    - @ref MmwDemo_mmWaveCtrlTask. This task is used to provide an execution
 *      context for the mmWave control, it calls in an endless loop the MMWave_execute API.
 *    - @ref mmwDemo_mssDPMTask. This task is used to provide an execution context for
 *      DPM (Data Path Manager) execution, it calls in an endless loop. There is no DPC registered
 *      with DPM.
 *    - @ref mmwDemo_mssUartDataExportTask. This task is used to export the data on UART. This task
 *      pends for @ref UartExportSemHandle in an endless loop, which is posted when current frame
 *      processing and previous frame's uart trasmission is completed.
 *
 *    **DSS**
 *    - @ref MmwDemo_initTask. This task is created/launched by @ref main and is a
 *      one-time active task whose main functionality is to initialize drivers (\<driver\>_init),
 *      DPM module (DPM_init), data path related drivers (EDMA, HWA, CSI), and
 *      create/launch the following tasks.
 *    - @ref MmwDemo_DPC_ObjectDetection_dpmTask. This task is used to provide an execution
 *      context for DPM (Data Path Manager) execution, it calls in an endless loop
 *      the DPM_execute API. In this context, all of the registered object detection
 *      DPC (Data Path Chain) APIs like configuration, control and execute will
 *      take place. In this task. When the DPC's execute API produces the detected objects and other
 *      results, they are reported to MSS where they are transmitted out of the UART port for display
 *      using the visualizer.
 *    - @ref MmwDemo_DPC_ObjectDetection_csirxTask. This task configures the CSI and waits for data
 *      from the frontend. It must be noted that it is necessary to perform the CSI configuration
 *      before moving onto the DPM configuration and synchronization, and this is implemented using
 *      a blocking semaphore.
 *    - @ref MmwDemo_DPC_ObjectDetection_FrameTrigTask. This task is used to send a message that
 *      a frame start trigger has been recieved, which is a signal for the processing chain to kick
 *      off. This task is basically in an endless loop, pending on a semaphore. When the CSI frame
 *      start callback function is entered, the semaphore is posted. Hence, the task sends a frame
 *      start trigger through the DPM which leads to the starting of the processing chain.
 *

 *   @image html datapath_overall_timingDDM.png "Top Level Data Path Timing - DDM"
 *
 *   The data path processing consists of taking ADC samples as input and producing
 *   detected objects (point-cloud and other information) to be shipped out of
 *   UART port to the PC. The algorithm processing is realized using
 *   the DPM registered Object Detection DPC. The details of the processing in DPC
 *   can be seen from the following doxygen documentation based on the processing chain
 *   to be used:
 *   @verbatim
      ti/datapath/dpc/objectdetection/objdethwa/docs/doxygen/html/index.html
     @endverbatim

     or
     @verbatim
      ti/datapath/dpc/objectdetection/objdethwaDDMA/docs/doxygen/html/index.html
     @endverbatim
 *
 *  @section DDMP Phase shifters (DDM)
 *   ti/datapath/dpc/objectdetection/objdethwaDDMA/docs/doxygen/html/index.html can be checked for information
 *   on why phase shifts are needed in the DDMA processing chain and what their values will be.
 *   @ref MmwDemo_RFParserPhaseShiftOrder in demo/utils/rf_parserDDMA.c arranges antennas in increasing order of phase shift value,
 *   if all of them were enabled For example, a value of {0,1,2} would mean that phase shifts for a particular chirp are
 *   in the following order of magnitude- tx0ChirpPhase > tx1ChirpPhase > tx2ChirpPhase
 *   Even if the user does not intend to use all the tx antennas, the order should be programmed assuming
 *   that all the Tx were enabled. The phase shift values for the ones that are not enabled will be
 *   configured to 0 by the code. \n
 *
 *   Note that in the DDMA case, the elevation antenna(s) should always come at the end of this array.
 *   Basically, phaseShift(azimuth) < phaseShift(elevation) must be ensured. Hence, {0, 2, 1} is configured
 *   for @ref MmwDemo_RFParserPhaseShiftOrder (AM273X), since Tx0, Tx2 are azimuth antennas and Tx1 is elevation antenna.
 *   To understand antenna configuration for AM273X, please refer to ti/board folder in the SDK.
 *
 * @section optimization DDMA Optimizations
 *  In order to reduce the processing time of DDMA chain, primarily following optimaztions are done:
 *  - HWA/DMA/DSP parallelization.
 *  - EDMA Polling instead of Interrupts.
 *  - Using Linear transfers in EDMA instead of Transpose transfers.
 *  - Parallelizing AoA processing with the next frame.
 *  - Parallelizing UART data sending the next frame.
 *  - Reduction of number of Azimuth Bins from 48 to 32.
 *  - Disable of Range CFAR / Sum TX.
 *  - Usage of IDMA in DSP for transfer.
 *  - Optimization of DSP code of AoA processing.
 *  - Optimization of DSP Code of DDMA Demodulation.
 *
 *   @image html DDM_optimization1.png "Parallelizing AoA processing and UART data transfer with the next frame"
 *
 *  As shown in the diagram, AoA uses DSP and 1D processing is done entirely on HWA, so both of them can be parallelized.
 *  Similarly, UART TX run entirely on R5F, so it can be parallelized with the processes riunning on HWA and DSP.
 *  So, after the parallel processing optimizations, AoA processing and UART transfer of the current frame can run in parallel
 *  with the 1D and 2D processing of the next frame.
 *
 *
 *  @section output Output information sent to host
 *      @subsection output_general Output Packet
 *      Output packets with the detection information are sent out every frame
 *      through the UART. Each packet consists of the header @ref MmwDemo_output_message_header_t
 *      and the number of TLV items containing various data information with
 *      types enumerated in @ref MmwDemo_output_message_type_e. The numerical values
 *      of the types can be found in @ref mmw_output.h. Each TLV
 *      item consists of type, length (@ref MmwDemo_output_message_tl_t) and payload information.
 *      The structure of the output packet is illustrated in the following figure.
 *      Since the length of the packet depends on the number of detected objects
 *      it can vary from frame to frame. The end of the packet is padded so that
 *      the total packet length is always multiple of 32 Bytes.
 *
 *      @image html output_packet_uart.png "Output packet structure sent to UART"
 *
 *      The following subsections describe the structure of each TLV.
 *
 *      @subsection tlv1 List of detected objects
 *       Type: (@ref MMWDEMO_OUTPUT_MSG_DETECTED_POINTS)
 *
 *       Length: (Number of detected objects) x (size of @ref DPIF_PointCloudCartesian_t)
 *
 *       Value: Array of detected objects. The information of each detected object
 *       is as per the structure @ref DPIF_PointCloudCartesian_t. When the number of
 *       detected objects is zero, this TLV item is not sent. The maximum number of
 *       objects that can be detected in a sub-frame/frame is @ref DPC_OBJDET_MAX_NUM_OBJECTS.
 *
 *       The orientation of x,y and z axes relative to the sensor is as per the
 *       following figure.
 *
 *        @image html coordinate_geometry.png "Coordinate Geometry"
 *
 *       The whole detected objects TLV structure is illustrated in figure below.
 *
 *       @image html detected_objects_tlv.png "Detected objects TLV"
 *
 *      @subsection tlv2 Range profile
 *       Type: (@ref MMWDEMO_OUTPUT_MSG_RANGE_PROFILE)
 *
 *       Length: (Range FFT size) x (size of uint16_t)
 *
 *       Value: Array of profile points at 0th Doppler (stationary objects).
 *       The points represent the sum of log2 magnitudes of received antennas
 *       expressed in Q9 format.
 *
 *      @subsection tlv3 Noise floor profile (sent only in TDM demo)
 *       Type: (@ref MMWDEMO_OUTPUT_MSG_NOISE_PROFILE)
 *
 *       Length: (Range FFT size) x (size of uint16_t)
 *
 *       Value: This is the same format as range profile but the profile
 *       is at the maximum Doppler bin (maximum speed
 *       objects). In general for stationary scene, there would be no objects or clutter at
 *       maximum speed so the range profile at such speed represents the
 *       receiver noise floor.
 *
 *      @subsection tlv4 Azimuth static heatmap (sent only in TDM demo)
 *       Type: (@ref MMWDEMO_OUTPUT_MSG_AZIMUT_STATIC_HEAT_MAP)
 *
 *       Length: (Range FFT size) x (Number of virtual antennas) (size of @ref cmplx16ImRe_t_)
 *
 *       Value: Array @ref DPU_AoAProcHWA_HW_Resources::azimuthStaticHeatMap. The antenna data
 *       are complex symbols, with imaginary first and real second in the following order:\n
 *       @verbatim
             Imag(ant 0, range 0), Real(ant 0, range 0),...,Imag(ant N-1, range 0),Real(ant N-1, range 0)
             ...
             Imag(ant 0, range R-1), Real(ant 0, range R-1),...,Imag(ant N-1, range R-1),Real(ant N-1, range R-1)
         @endverbatim
 *       Based on this data the static azimuth heat map is constructed by the GUI
 *       running on the host.
 *
 *      @subsection tlv5 Range/Doppler heatmap
 *       Type: (@ref MMWDEMO_OUTPUT_MSG_RANGE_DOPPLER_HEAT_MAP)
 *
 *       Length: (Range FFT size) x (Doppler FFT size) (size of uint16_t)
 *
 *       Value: Detection matrix @ref DPIF_DetMatrix::data.
 *       The order is : \n
 *       @verbatim
            X(range bin 0, Doppler bin 0),...,X(range bin 0, Doppler bin D-1),
            ...
            X(range bin R-1, Doppler bin 0),...,X(range bin R-1, Doppler bin D-1)
         @endverbatim
 *
 *      @subsection tlv6 Stats information
 *       Type: (@ref MMWDEMO_OUTPUT_MSG_STATS )
 *
 *       Length: (size of @ref MmwDemo_output_message_stats_t)
 *
 *       Value: Timing information as per @ref MmwDemo_output_message_stats_t.
 *       See timing diagram below related to the stats.
 *
 *      @image html processing_timing.png "Processing timing"
 *
 *       Note:
 *       -#  The @ref MmwDemo_output_message_stats_t::interChirpProcessingMargin is not
 *           computed (it is always set to 0). This is because there is no CPU involvement
 *           in the 1D processing (only HWA and EDMA are involved), and it is not possible to
 *           know how much margin is there in chirp processing without CPU being notified
 *           at every chirp when processing begins (chirp event) and when the HWA-EDMA
 *           computation ends. The CPU is intentionally kept free during 1D processing
 *           because a real application may use this time for doing some post-processing
 *           algorithm execution.
 *       -#  While the
 *           @ref MmwDemo_output_message_stats_t::interFrameProcessingTime reported
 *           will be of the current sub-frame/frame,
 *           the @ref MmwDemo_output_message_stats_t::interFrameProcessingMargin and
 *           @ref MmwDemo_output_message_stats_t::transmitOutputTime
 *           will be of the previous sub-frame (of the same
 *           @ref MmwDemo_output_message_header_t::subFrameNumber as that of the
 *           current sub-frame) or of the previous frame.
 *       -#  The @ref MmwDemo_output_message_stats_t::interFrameProcessingMargin excludes
 *           the UART transmission time (available as
 *           @ref MmwDemo_output_message_stats_t::transmitOutputTime). This is done
 *           intentionally to inform the user of a genuine inter-frame processing margin
 *           without being influenced by a slow transport like UART, this transport time
 *           can be significantly longer for example when streaming out debug information like
 *           heat maps. Also, in a real product deployment, higher speed interfaces (e.g LVDS)
 *           are likely to be used instead of UART. User can calculate the margin
 *           that includes transport overhead (say to determine the max frame rate
 *           that a particular demo configuration will allow) using the stats
 *           because they also contain the UART transmission time.
 *
 *      The CLI command \"guMonitor\" specifies which TLV element will
 *      be sent out within the output packet. The arguments of the CLI command are stored
 *      in the structure @ref MmwDemo_GuiMonSel_t.
 *
 *      @subsection tlv7 Side information of detected objects (sent only in TDM demo)
 *       Type: (@ref MMWDEMO_OUTPUT_MSG_DETECTED_POINTS_SIDE_INFO)
 *
 *       Length: (Number of detected objects) x (size of @ref DPIF_PointCloudSideInfo_t)
 *
 *       Value: Array of detected objects side information. The side information
 *       of each detected object is as per the structure @ref DPIF_PointCloudSideInfo_t).
 *       When the number of detected objects is zero, this TLV item is not sent.
 *
 *      @subsection tlv9 Temperature Stats
 *       Type: (@ref MMWDEMO_OUTPUT_MSG_TEMPERATURE_STATS)
 *
 *       Length: (size of @ref MmwDemo_temperatureStats_t)
 *
 *       Value: Structure of detailed temperature report as obtained from Radar front end.
 *       @ref MmwDemo_temperatureStats_t::tempReportValid is set to return value of
 *       rlRfGetTemperatureReport. If @ref MmwDemo_temperatureStats_t::tempReportValid is 0,
 *       values in @ref MmwDemo_temperatureStats_t::temperatureReport are valid else they should
 *       be ignored. This TLV is sent along with Stats TLV described in @ref tlv6
 *
 *  @section Calibration_section Range Bias (only supported in TDM) and Rx Channel Gain/Phase Measurement and Compensation
 *
 *     Because of imperfections in antenna layouts on the board, RF delays in SOC, etc,
 *     there is need to calibrate the sensor to compensate for bias in the range estimation and
 *     receive channel gain and phase imperfections. The following figure illustrates
 *     the calibration procedure.
 *
 *     @anchor Figure_calibration_ladder_diagram
 *     @image html calibration_ladder_diagram.png "Calibration procedure ladder diagram"
 *
 *      The calibration procedure includes the following steps:
 *     -# Set a strong target like corner reflector at the distance of X meter
 *     (X less than 50 cm is not recommended) at boresight.
 *     -# Set the following command
 *     in the configuration profile in .../profiles/profile_calibration.cfg,
 *     to reflect the position X as follows:
 *     @verbatim
       measureRangeBiasAndRxChanPhase 1 X D
       @endverbatim
 *     where D (in meters) is the distance of window around X where the peak will be searched.
 *     The purpose of the search window is to allow the test environment from not being overly constrained
 *     say because it may not be possible to clear it of all reflectors that may be stronger than the one used
 *     for calibration. The window size is recommended to be at least the distance equivalent of a few range bins.
 *     One range bin for the calibration profile (profile_calibration.cfg) is about 5 cm.
 *     The first argument "1" is to enable the measurement. The stated configuration
 *     profile (.cfg) must be used otherwise the calibration may not work as expected
 *     (this profile ensures all transmit and receive antennas are engaged among
 *     other things needed for calibration).
 *     -# Start the sensor with the configuration file.
 *     -# In the configuration file, the measurement is enabled because of which
 *     the DPC will be configured to perform the measurement and generate
 *     the measurement result (@ref DPU_AoAProc_compRxChannelBiasCfg_t in TDM and @ref Measure_compRxChannelBiasCfg_t in DDM) in its
 *     result structure (@ref DPC_ObjectDetection_ExecuteResult_t::compRxChanBiasMeasurement),
 *     the measurement results are written out on the CLI port (@ref MmwDemo_measurementResultOutput)
 *     in the format below:
 *     @verbatim
       TDM: compRangeBiasAndRxChanPhase <rangeBias> <Re(0,0)> <Im(0,0)> <Re(0,1)> <Im(0,1)> ... <Re(0,R-1)> <Im(0,R-1)> <Re(1,0)> <Im(1,0)> ... <Re(T-1,R-1)> <Im(T-1,R-1)>
       @endverbatim
 *     \n
 *
 *     @verbatim
       DDM: compRxChanPhase <Im(0,0)> <Re0,0)> <Im(0,1)> <Re(0,1)> ... <Im(0,R-1)> <Re(0,R-1)> <Im(1,0)> <Re(1,0)> ... <Im(T-1,R-1)> <Re(T-1,R-1)>
       where TX antenna order is such that azimuth Tx antennas are followed by the elevation TX antennas.
       @endverbatim

       For details of how DPC performs the measurement, see the DPC documentation.
 *     -# The command printed out on the CLI now can be copied and pasted in any
 *     configuration file for correction purposes. This configuration will be
 *     passed to the DPC for the purpose  of applying compensation during angle
 *     computation, the details of this can be seen in the DPC documentation.
 *     If compensation is not desired,
 *     the following command should be given
 *     @verbatim
       TDM: compRangeBiasAndRxChanPhase 0.0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
       @endverbatim
 *     \n

 *
 *  @section LVDSStreamingNotes Streaming data over LVDS
 *
 *    The LVDS streaming feature enables the streaming of HW data (ADC data)
 *    and/or user specific SW data through LVDS interface.
 *    The streaming is done mostly by the CBUFF and EDMA peripherals with minimal CPU intervention.
 *    The streaming is configured through the @ref MmwDemo_LvdsStreamCfg_t CLI command which
 *    allows control of HSI header, enable/disable of HW and SW data and data format choice for the HW data. Note
 *    that only HW data without HSI header is supported as of now.
 *    The choices for data formats for HW data are:
 *      - @ref MMW_DEMO_LVDS_STREAM_CFG_DATAFMT_DISABLED
 *      - @ref MMW_DEMO_LVDS_STREAM_CFG_DATAFMT_ADC
 *
 *    When HW data LVDS streaming is enabled, the ADC data is streamed per
 *    chirp on every chirp event.
 *    -# For HW data, the inter-chirp duration should be sufficient to stream out the desired amount
 *       of data. For example, if the HW data-format is ADC and HSI header is enabled (note: HSI
 *       header sending is not enabled in this demo),
 *       then the total amount of data generated per chirp
 *       is:\n
 *        (numAdcSamples * numRxChannels * 4 (size of complex sample) +
 *       52 [sizeof(HSIDataCardHeader_t) + sizeof(HSISDKHeader_t)] )
 *       rounded up to multiples of 256 [=sizeof(HSIHeader_t)] bytes.\n
 *       The chirp time Tc in us = idle time + ramp end time in the profile configuration.
 *       For n-lane LVDS with each lane at a maximum of B Mbps,\n
 *       maximum number of bytes that can be send per chirp = Tc * n * B / 8 which
 *       should be greater than the total amount of data generated per chirp i.e\n
 *       Tc * n * B / 8 >= round-up(numAdcSamples * numRxChannels * 4 + 52, 256). \n
 *       E.g if n = 2, B = 600 Mbps, idle time = 7 us, ramp end time = 44 us, numAdcSamples = 512,
 *       numRxChannels = 4, then 7650 >= 8448 is violated so this configuration will not work.
 *       If the idle-time is doubled in the above example, then we have 8700 > 8448, so
 *       this configuration will work.
 *    -# The total amount of data to be transmitted in a HW or SW packet must be greater than the
 *       minimum required by CBUFF, which is 64 bytes or 32 CBUFF Units (this is the definition
 *       CBUFF_MIN_TRANSFER_SIZE_CBUFF_UNITS in the CBUFF driver implementation).
 *       If this threshold condition is violated, the CBUFF driver will return an error during
 *       configuration and the demo will generate a fatal exception as a result.
 *       When HSI header is enabled, the total transfer size is ensured to be at least
 *       256 bytes, which satisfies the minimum. If HSI header is disabled, for the HW session,
 *       this means that numAdcSamples * numRxChannels * 4 >= 64. Although mmwavelink
 *       allows minimum number of ADC samples to be 2, the demo is supported
 *       for numAdcSamples >= 64. So HSI header is not required to be enabled for HW only case.
 *
 *   @subsection lvdsImpl Implementation Notes
 *
 *    -# The LVDS implementation is mostly present in mmw_lvds_stream.h and
 *      mmw_lvds_stream.c with calls in mss_main.c. Additionally HSI
 *      clock initialization is done at first time sensor start using @ref MmwDemo_mssSetHsiClk. Also see the
 *      @ MmwDemo_BoardInit function for register configuration related to HSI clock.
 *    -# EDMA channel resources for CBUFF/LVDS are in the global resource file
 *      (mmw_res.h, see @ref resourceAlloc) along with other EDMA resource allocation.
 *      The user data header and two user payloads are configured as three user buffers in the CBUFF driver.
 *      Hence SW allocation for EDMA provides for three sets of EDMA resources as seen in
 *      the SW part (swSessionEDMAChannelTable[.]) of @ref MmwDemo_LVDSStream_EDMAInit.
 *    -# Although the CBUFF driver is configured for two sessions (hw and sw),
 *      at any time only one can be active. So depending on the LVDS CLI configuration
 *      and whether advanced frame or not, there is logic to activate/deactivate
 *      HW and SW sessions as necessary.
 *    -# The CBUFF session (HW/SW) configure-create and delete
 *      depends on whether or not re-configuration is required after the
 *      first time configuration.
 *      -# For HW session, re-configuration is done during sub-frame switching to
 *        re-configure for the next sub-frame but when there is no advanced frame
 *        (number of sub-frames = 1), the HW configuration does not need to
 *        change so HW session does not need to be re-created.
 *    -# SW-trigger-based streaming is not supported in the current release.
 *
 *    The following figure shows a timing diagram for the LVDS streaming
 *    (the figure is not to scale as actual durations will vary based on configuration).
 *    Note: SW streaming is not supported in the current version of the demo.

 *
 *  @section EnetStreamingNotes Streaming data over Ethernet
 *
 *    This demo supports a simple use case of transferring detected objects data over Ethernet using
 *    TCP protocol and LwIP stack. The data transfer is done using a client-server based architecture
 *    with the EVM acting as the client and the PC acting as a server. This utility is a modified
 *    example of the TCPECHO app that comes packages as a part of LwIP in the PDK.
 *    For connection and usage details, please refer to the MMWAVE SDK User Guide.
 *
 *   @subsection enetImpl Implementation Notes
 *
 *    -# The enet streaming utility comes as a part of the files enet_cpswconfighandler.c, enet_stream.c
 *       enet_tcpclient.c and tcpserver.py files.
 *    -# enetTask in enet_stream.c is the main task that initializes all the components and tasks, and has an IP
 *       address assigned to the device through DHCP.
 *    -# Once the IP is assigned to the device, the user can run the server application tcpserver.py and wait for
 *       connection establishment.
 *    -# Command queryLocalIp can be used through CLI to return the local IP (IP address acquired by EVM). Refer to the
 *       User Guide for more details.
 *    -# The user will send the local IP through the enetStreamCfg command using CLI. Refer to the
 *       User Guide for more details. Once this configuration is done, the semaphore EnetCfgDoneSemHandle
 *       will be posted, and connection will be established (see tcpclient.c).
 *    -# The user will be able to see the object data getting printed on the console of tcpserver.py.
 *    -# Note that the communication port is pre-configured as "7".
 *    -# It must be noted that the LwIP stack requires 650 kB of extra memory (L3 RAM), and care must be taken to
 *       ensure that the demo L3 requirements do not result in higher L3 memory usage than what is available.
 *
 *  @section bypassCLI How to bypass CLI
 *
 *    Re-implement the file mmw_cli.c as follows:
 *
 *    -# @ref MmwDemo_CLIInit should just create a task with input taskPriority.
 *       Lets say the task is called "MmwDemo_sensorConfig_task".
 *    -# All other functions are not needed
 *    -# Implement the MmwDemo_sensorConfig_task as follows:
 *       - Fill gMmwMssMCB.cfg.openCfg
 *       - Fill gMmwMssMCB.cfg.ctrlCfg
 *       - Add profiles and chirps using @ref MMWave_addProfile and @ref MMWave_addChirp functions
 *       - Call @ref MmwDemo_CfgUpdate for every offset in @ref configStoreOffsets
 *         (MMWDEMO_xxx_OFFSET in mmw_mss.h)
 *       - Fill gMmwMssMCB.objDetCommonCfg.preStartCommonCfg
 *       - Call @ref MmwDemo_openSensor
 *       - Call @ref MmwDemo_configSensor
 *       - Call @ref MmwDemo_startSensor (One can use helper function
 *         @ref MmwDemo_isAllCfgInPendingState to know if all dynamic config was provided)
 *    -# The user can also use the CLI_BYPASS API in the CLI library to directly bypass the CLI
 *       command send over UART.
 *
 *  @section resourceAlloc Hardware Resource Allocation
 *    The Object Detection DPC needs to configure the DPUs hardware resources (HWA, EDMA).
 *    Even though the hardware resources currently are only required to be allocated
 *    for this one and only DPC in the system, the resource partitioning is shown to be in
 *    the ownership of the demo. This is to illustrate the general
 *    case of resource allocation across more than one DPCs and/or demo's own
 *    processing that is post-DPC processing. This partitioning
 *    can be seen in the mmw_res.h file. This file is passed as a compiler command line
 *    define @verbatim "--define=APP_RESOURCE_FILE="<ti/demo/am273x/mmw/mmw_resDDM.h>" @endverbatim
 *    or  @verbatim "--define=APP_RESOURCE_FILE="<ti/demo/am273x/mmw/mmw_resTDM.h>" @endverbatim
 *    in mmw_mss.mak and mmw_dss.mak when building the DPC sources as part of building the demo application and
 *    is referred in object detection DPC sources where needed as
 *    @verbatim #include APP_RESOURCE_FILE @endverbatim
 *
 *  @section demoDesignNotes Design Notes
 *
 *  Due to the limitation of DPM local queue size, for certain DPM functions such as @ref DPM_start, @ref DPM_stop and
 *  some of the DPC control through @ref DPM_ioctl, semaphores are used to sync between calling task and function
 *  @ref MmwDemo_DPC_ObjectDetection_reportFxn. So that it won't cause DPM crash because of running out of
 *  DPM local queues. The following diagram demonstrates the example calling flow for blocking @ref DPM_ioctl() function call.
 *  Non-blocking @ref DPM_ioctl is also shown for comparison.
 *
 *  @image html dpm_ioctl_handling.png "DPM_ioctl calling flow"
 *
 *  There are DPM report functions on both MSS and DSS for the same DPM_Report. However the sequence is not guaranteed between the
 *  two cores.
 *
 *  @section memoryUsage Memory Usage
 *  @subsection memUsageSummary Memory usage summary
 *    Please refer to the respective .map files in the demo folder for information on memory usage.
 *
 *  @section error Note on Error Codes
 *
 *    ------------------------------
 *    When demo runs into error conditions, an error code will be generated and printed out.
 *    Error code is defined as a negative interger. It comes from the following categories:
 *    - Drivers
 *    - Control modules
 *    - Data Processing Chain
 *    - Data Processing Unit
 *    - Demo
 *
 *    The error code is defined as (Module  error code base - Module specific error code).\n
 *    The base error code for the above modules can be found in @ref mmwave_error.h\n
 *    The base error code for DPC and DPU can be found in @ref dp_error.h
 *
 *    Module specific error code is specified in the module's header file.
 *    Examples:
 *       - UART driver error code is defined in uart.h
 *       - DPC error code is defined in the dpc used in demo
 *
 *  @subsection mmwave_error mmWave module Error Code
 *    Error code from mmWave module is encoded in the following manner:
 *
 *    Bits(31::16)  |  Bits(15::2)   | Bits (1::0)
 *    :-------------|:----------------|:-------------:
 *    mmwave  error  | Subsystem error   | error level
 *
 *    - mmwave error is defined in mmwave.h \n
 *    - Subsystem error is returned from sub-system such as mmwavelink and mailbox driver. \n
 *    - Error level is referred as WARNING leve and ERROR level.
 *    - mmWave exposes an API - MMWave_decodeError() that can be used in demo to decode error code
 *
 *  @subsection mmwave_error_example Example
 *    - Here is an example on how to parse the error code - "-40111"\n
 *        -# The error code is from module with error base "-40000", which indicates it is DPC error.\n
 *        -# By referring to @ref dp_error.h, base "-40100" is from HWA based objectdetection DPC.\n
 *        -# Then find the error code in objectdetection.h for error(-11) as DPC_OBJECTDETECTION_ENOMEM__L3_RAM_RADAR_CUBE
 *
 *    - Another example is with mmWave control module: - "mmWave Config failed [Error code: -3109 Subsystem: 71]"\n
 *        -# The above message indicates the error is from module(-3100 ->mmwave) with error -9(MMWAVE_ECHIRPCFG)\n
 *        -# The subsystem(mmwavelink) error is 71(RL_RET_CODE_CHIRP_TX_ENA_1INVAL_IN) which can be found in mmwavelink.h
